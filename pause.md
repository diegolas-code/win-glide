# Current Status - win-glide

## Recent Achievements
- **Phase 8: Performance & Optimization (Completed)**
    - **Zero-Copy Rendering:** Refactored overlay rendering to draw directly into Win32 GDI memory, achieving "instant" appearance.
    - **Lean RAM Footprint:** Achieved and stabilized a **1.2MB Working Set** by using on-demand GDI resource allocation and slimming the window class.
    - **API Churn Reduction:** Implemented integer-based rectangle tracking to skip redundant Win32 `DeferWindowPos` calls when stationary.
    - **Elevated Window Safety:** Proactively detects and skips high-integrity windows (like Task Manager) to prevent OS access errors.
    - **Stability Focus:** Chose a stable 120Hz polling loop over blocking "Sleep Mode" to ensure perfect UI responsiveness and message pumping.

## Immediate Next Steps
- **Phase 9: Productization**
    - Create a release-optimized build profile.
    - Implement a system tray icon for status visibility and graceful exit.
    - Research and implement a simple installer.

## Technical Notes
- The 1.2MB RAM usage is the stable "warmed-up" baseline after the first activation.
- The app is optimized for "silence" - consuming near-zero CPU and minimizing OS API interaction while backgrounded.
